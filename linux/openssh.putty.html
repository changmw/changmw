<p>This is a guide about using Putty on Windows with OpenSSH on Linux. You
would learn about how to:
<nl>
<li>configure OpenSSH on linux side to accept version 2 public-key authentication.
<li>create public and private keys with OpenSSH on the linux side,
<li>convert OpenSSH keys to Putty format using puttygen.exe at the Window side,
<li>use putty.exe to talk to OpenSSH using the converted private key.
<ul>
<p>I would assume that you have OpenSSH installed. As per 31-May-2006, the latest version of OpenSSH was 4.3p1. Your Linux distribution may likely use an older version, however.  
</div> <!-- preamble>

<!-- Put the body of your procedure in the following div -->
<div id="steps">
<h2>Configuring OpenSSH to accept public-key authentication</h2>
<p>To enable your OpenSSH to accept version 2 public key, you would need to modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config. You could use vi editor (or whatever editor you are familiar with) to uncomment/add/modify the following lines to /etc/ssh/sshd_config:</p>
<p><pre>
# the default SSH port is 22, you could alter it if necessary
Port 22

# accept version 2 keys only
Protocol 2

# NEVER allow root to login directly over the net
PermitRootLogin no
StrictModes yes
MaxAuthTries 3

# enable public-key authentication
RSAAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# securing your OpenSSH
# do not use host-based authentication for security reason
RhostsRSAAuthentication no
HostbasedAuthentication no
IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes
PermitEmptyPassword no

# do not allow telnet-type login for security reason
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PasswordAuthentication no

X11Forwarding yes
X11DisplayOffset 10
</pre>
<p>After you have made changes to /etc/ssh/sshd_config,  you would need to restart the OpenSSH daemon by executing `/etc/init.d/ssh restart` (on Ubuntu).

<h2>Generating OpenSSH private and public key pair</h2>
<p>To use public key authentication, the first step is to generate a pair of private and public keys on the Linux side. I would assume that you login as a user called "toylet".
<pre>
1. Login Linux as user "toylet". You could do it at the Linux console
   or via telnet.
2. Execute `ssh-keygen -t rsa` to generate a version 2 public
   and private key pair into directory /home/user/.ssh.
   The passphrase is optional (but preferred).

toylet@server:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/toylet/.ssh/id_rsa):
/home/toylet/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/toylet/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/toylet/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
ec:f4:3f:b5:fe:2f:de:22:6c:42:8c:38:ad:6c:5e:96 toylet@server

3. Execute `cd /home/toylet/.ssh`
4. You should see 2 files: id_rsa and id_rsa.pub.
   Now execute the following command:
   cp id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
5. Copy /home/toylet/.ssh/id_rsa from Linux to Windows.
</pre>
<h2>Converting the OpenSSH private key to Putty format</h2>
<p>Next, we head to the Windows side. In step 4, you created two key files (id_rsa and id_rsa.pub). Putty cannot directly open OpenSSH keys. We need to convert id_rsa to id_rsa.ppk using a program called puttygen.exe.
<pre>
6. At the Windows side, download puttygen.exe from <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">Putty website</a>.
7. Execute puttygen.exe
</pre>
<img src="openssh.putty.0.jpg">
<pre>
8. Click File->Load Private Key, load the file "id_rsa" from Step 5.
   Enter the passphrase if you used it in step 2.
</pre>
<img src="openssh.putty.1.jpg">
<pre>
9. Now the key has been loaded as in the figure above.
   Hit the button "Save private key".
   The converted key would be saved as "id_rsa.ppk".
</pre>

<h2>Logging in Openssh using id_rsa.ppk</h2>
<p>Download putty.exe from <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">Putty website</a>. It's time to really login OpenSSH using putty.exe on Windows side. The steps here would be a little bit more complicated.
<pre>
10. Invoke putty.exe
10.1. Click "Session" in the sidebar.
</pre>
<img src="openssh.putty.2.jpg">
<pre>
10.1.1. Enter ip address of your server (e.g., 192.168.1.2)
10.1.2. Click "SSH" in the Protocol option
10.2. Choose "SSH" under "Connection" in the sidebar
</pre>
<img src="openssh.putty.3.jpg">
<pre>
10.2.1. In "Preferred SSH protocol version", select "2 only"
10.2.2. click "Auth" under "SSH"
</pre>
<img src="openssh.putty.4.jpg">
<pre>
10.2.2.1. Hit the Browse button, select the file "id_rsa.ppk" from Step 9.
10.3. hit "Session" again in step 10.1
</pre>
<img src="openssh.putty.5.jpg">
<pre>
10.3.1. Enter a name (e.g. "toylet.session") in the textbox directly
        under "Saved Sessions".
10.3.2. Hit the "Save" button. The name "toylet.session" would appear in
        the listbox of "Saved Sessions".
</pre>
<img src="openssh.putty.6.jpg">
<pre>
10.4. Double-click "toylet.session". Now you would be presented
      with a login screen for OpenSSH.
10.4.1. Enter the linux user name "toylet"
10.4.2. Enter the passphrase if you specified it in step 2.

Login as: toylet
Authenticating with public key "imported-openssh-key"
Passphrase for key "imported-openssh-key":
Last login: Wed May 31 12:35:00 2006 from 192.168.1.10
toylet@server:~$

11. You have successfully logged into your Linux server via OpenSSH.
</pre>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<ul>
<li>You should change both your private and public keys periodically by repeating the steps above.
<li>You may disable the telnet daemon foreever since telnet doesn't encrypt the connection, allowing eavedropping easily.
<li>Alternative: <a href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/putty-openssh.html">Using Puttygen as key generator</a>
<li>Puttygen could become a platform for finding the passphrase for your private key via dictionary attack. What you need is puttygen.exe and a simple WSH (Windows Scripting Host) script. So DO NOT let others get a copy of your private key. If you really failed to protect the key (owning to theft or loss), generate a new key IMMEDIATELY.
