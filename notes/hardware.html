<li>The DVI port of Philips 220WS8FB LCD monitor was dead completely.
<li>Plugging in an old PS/2 mouse to the Biostar BTC-250-PRO gave you two mouse pointers when entering its BIOS.
<li>The Asrock J3455M motherboard got loose RAM contact problem. Need to push the edge of the motherboard near its RAM slots upward slightly, or the board would not POST.
<li>I thought the Gigabyte Z370-HD3P was dead. But it turned out that it was not. I possibly missed something obvious when turning on the PC. And I did not sleep well then.
<li>Based on feeling only: the Intel Core i3-12100F was slightly slower than Core i7-9700KF when rendering webpages in Firefox(profile in RAM disk). And it's a lot cheaper!!

<li>Replaced the damaged plastic knob for Panasonic CW-N721JA from Shun Hing free-of-charge. But the damaged one (was new and came with the air conditioner) had to be returned. It's obvious that the new knob WILL break again because of poor design in terms of stress force. The 4-mode on-off switch of CW-N721JA was very tight when rotating. It's strange the axile of the on-off switch was plastic, while the switch for temperature control was METAL and could be rotated easily with the damaged knob!! Was there a manufacturing mistake?? Politics between Beijing and Japan??
<li>I tried to repair the damaged knob using eproxy putty. It worked for a while and then broke again.

<li>It seemed that SIM Slot 1 in the Redmi A3 had to be occupied for the mobile data connection to reach maximum speed!! If you just used SIM Slot 2, the mobile data would work in lower speed and with greater latency.
<li>BTW, Xioami Redmi A5 had been released, and Xioami claimed that it could produce 3nm processor XRing 01.
<li>It seemed that my Smartone prepaid SIM in SIM Slot 1 of Nokia 2710 Fold could not use 4G LTE voice calls. The CMHK Prepaid SIM in SIM Slot 2 did NOT demonstrate the same problem. Also, Nokia 2720 Fold (running KaiOS) could only allow one SIM Slot to use 4G (the one with Mobile Data turned on).
<li>I believe Nokia had given up KaiOS and stopped producing phones based on it. Wish that KaiOS (based on Firefox OS) might live on as an open-sourced projecct, and that it would not end up becoming spyware nor malware!! The KaiOS Store app was still a bit buggy after a reset.
<li>I suspect the rechargeable battery of my Nokia 2710 Fold could no longer work at its best. It lost charges quite rapidly, sometimes losing as much as 10% in just a day. Not sure whether it's KaiOS' problems... or was it SPYware? I was using only built-in apps (Facebook and WhatsApp deleted).

<li>Sister's Toshiba Canvio Advance 4TB external hard disk was still not responding to USB connection. It's still in the warranty period, so it's not wise to crack open it to test the 2.5" hard disk inside directly....
<li>A 13-year old Western Digital My Passport 500G external hard disk no longer worked. Dunno whether someone stole the working one and replaced it with a bad one. Or maybe I forgot to power it on for over a year.
<li>Opened the black plastic case of the WD My Passport 500G external hard disk, and found that the circuit board of the WD5000LMVW disk did NOT have any SATA ports. So it's impossible to bypass its USB firmware and check whether the hard disk itself was really dead. There was "Not For Resale" printed on its white label.
<li>The iMation DVR-6005 DMB-TH TV recorder suddenly complaint about the Hitachi HTS545025B9A300, saying that it was not detected. But the hard disk was working when connected it to my desktop PC directly.
<li>One of the hard disk in my desktop PC reported a temperature of over 50 degress. Turned out one 120mm fan was not working and that a hard disk had dislocated in the SATA hard disk rack.

<li>The Sapphire R9 285 GPU was unable to wake up the Philips 220WS8FB monitor (DVI function damaged) via the DVI port. No problem with the older Philips 170B5 monitor.
<li>White tear marks appeared in the outer plastic sheet of Philips 220WS8FB monitor, but not as serious as the older 170B5 monitor.
<li>Now that support for Win 7/8/8.1 had been dropped by Micro$oft, Nvidia driver beyond build 474.11 would no longer be WHQL certified and would be ignored by Win 7/8/8.1, unless driver signing was disabled. Asus' website offered Win 8.1 driver build 417.71 for GT1030-SL-2GD4-BRK.
<li>Support for Win 10 will also end in October this year. Nevertheless, Win 11 had some bad cumulative updates causing loss of functionalities. Lately there was some rumours about Win 12.
<li>Artificial intelligence (notably neural network and learning models) was a hot topic these days, notably OpenAI's ChatGPT and lately DeepSeek. Micro$oft added its AI asisstant called Copilot into Windows 10 and 11, as well as Office 365. AI also fueled the stock price of Nvidia (previously by BitCoin mining).

<li>The motor of Sony CMT-M333NT's CD drive was making loud noise like a shaver, ejecting its tray itself. It was unclear whether it's the firmware (bit rot?), a sticky button or hardware fault. It's strange that the motor was not turned off when switching mode away from CD. The easy solution is to cut the power cables to the motor.
<li>The spindle motor of the Toshiba 3.5" 2TB SATA hard disk (DT01ACA200) was still clicking after powered on.

<li>Pry open the Asus RT-N18U using a steel ruler, along the front edge of the router. The circuit board has the printing "ASUS RT-N18U REV 2.20". The 3 capacitors (4E4-100-16V, E479-300-6.3V, 470-25A-K64) are clean, no leakage of fluid. Not sure whether they are solid capacitors. No bulging as well. I found no burnt marks on the dark cyan PCB, front and back. I haven't removed the big heatsink, which is unnecessary as the firmware was basically working fine. The 4-pin serial header J3 is now visible and accessible. There are two kind of induction coils labeled "1419 HN36201CG" for the LAN ports, and one coil labelled "1419 HN18101CG" for the WAN port. Would they affect connection?
<li>The top plastic cover of Asus RT-N18U is so tightly sealing the router that I don't know why 4 screws are needed.
<li>Because all LAN ports are dead, serial recovery using the J3 jumper is impossible as TFTP needs a LAN port. I don't think the serial port allow local uploading of file.

<li>Spent roughly 4 hours upgrading the Window$ 8 Home in the HP Envy H9 Pheonix PC to Window$ 10 Home. The process began with running the Cyberlink Recovery Manager in the Micron 120G SSD to reinstall Win 8 cleanly without personal data (backup first if you got data). Because Win 8 was too old, you need to first enable TLS over HTTP using registry and KB3140245. Then you could run Windows Update like normal to upgrade Win 8 to its most recent build. This might need hours using a wired connection to internet. After that, you could download then run Win 10's Media Creation Tool, and upgrade the old Win 8 directly to Win 10, skipping Windows 8.1.
<li>You might wanna skip Win 10 and directly go for Windows 11, but this would be your own trial. 
<li>Now that Win 10 was installed, one could use a new and bigger SATA SSD to install Win 10 directly from Win 10 ISO *without* the HP Win 8 Recovery Manager. That will use far less time than going through the 8-to-10 upgrade process. But the process converted the Win 8 OEM/VLS product key to Win 10 digital entitlement. It's just a "digital entitlement" because you didn't pay for a real Win 10 product key.
<li>If TLS over HTTP was not enabled, Win 8 would report error 0x800072F8F during Windows Update. Then Win 10 Media Creation Tool would report error 0x80072EE7. The Internet Explorer in Win 8 could NOT access most websites because HTTPS is standard requirement now.
<li>Four hours was really a waste of time. So I was doing other things while waiting for it. :)
<li>Why didn't Micro$oft just provide a fast program just to convert eligeble Win 7/8/8.1 product key to Win 10 digital entitlement without the need to run Windows Update then Media Creation Tool for hours?
<li>Using a new SSD to install Win 10 might break the Secured Boot feature in the UEFI BIOS of the HP Envy H9 PC. You can of course disable Secured Boot or rebuild it from the installed Win 10. I don't wanna try it now, not my non-business use.
<li>BTW, I discarded the original black HP SATA cables in the H9 PC and replaced them with red cheap ones. That hopefully might prevent disk drive connection and detection issue reported by the original owner of this PC.
<li>Speaking of Windows 11, Windows 12 might be released next year (2024), possibly with an A.I. theme! And Windows 10 will lose its Micro$oft support the following year (14th October 2025). I dunno whether Win 8 and Win 10 could be upgraded directly to Win 12 without payment in the future.

<li>It really looked like all those overclocking problems in the past few years were caused by either directly by the faulty and possibly overheated Adata SX8200 Pro SSD, the use of both M.2 slots in the Gigabyte Z370-HD3P or just the hardened thermal paste on the Intel i7 CPU. The dust on the heatsink fins shouldn't be that a factor.

<li>Suddenly, the Adata SX8200 Pro M.2 SSD was dead. I always thought that the problem was the AGI Rapidity Pro because it disappeared first when the PC hanged in UEFI mode. It looked like the BIOS failed to get past the detection of the Adata SX8200 Pro M.2 SSD after it stalled, which caused the disappearance of the other M.2 SSD (AGI Rapidity Pro).
<li>Reinstalled Windows 10 Pro in the AGI Rapidity Pro. Needed to use DISKPART to clean the partition table and reboot first.
<li>The death of the Adata SX8200 Pro made the BIOS behave strangly. It suddenly reported the Intel i7-9700KF having an internal GPU, which was wrong. I needed to use Restore Optimized Defaults in the BIOS to fix it.
<li>Whenever Win 10 hanged, the disk activity LED was always lit. This might overheat the Adata SSD, causing it to self-destruct. I dunno why its SSD controller didn't throttle itself or better stop working.

<li>Now that it's summer with higher ambient temperature over 30 degree Celsius and without air-conditioning, the Gigabyte Z370-HD3P with Intel Core i7-9700KF CPU would freeze when using XMP profile of the DDR4 RAM with CPU settings at default. I suspect the memory controller on the CPU chip was overheated when XMP was enabled together with CPU Turbo Boost. Maybe the CoolerMaster Hyper 212X CPU Cooler was not efficient enough.
<li>The solution to overclock the DDR4 RAM was to lower the max CPU Turbo Boost Frequency and inputting DDR4 voltage & timing parameters manually, without relying on any automatic XMP profiles.
<li>The following were the BIOS parameters that overlocked the DDR4 RAMs without issues:
<ul><li>CPU Turbo Boost Core Frequencies: 46,43,42,41,41,40,40,40 (down from 49,48,48,47,47,46,46,46)

<li>Remember the mysterious disappeance of M.2 SSD during BIOS POST? It had nothing to do with the arrangement of DDR4 RAM moduloes, nor the CR2023 battery, nor the USB 2.0 ports, nor the need to clear CMOS. The solution is to drain all leftover electricty out of the PC before turning it back on again. Somehow leftover electricity kept old settings in some "memory", making the BIOS detect wrong status of various M.2 SSD drives. In general, the M.2 SSDs (especially the one containing Window$ 10) disappeared after Window$ crashed or froze, and when Window$ was using UEFI boot. Note that the EFI partition (for UEFI boot) was writtable at all time.
<li>To drain all leftover electricity out of the PC, just unplug the power cord or switch off the power supply, then push the power button a few times. An interesting thing was that the LED of the DDR4 RAM would light up for a few seconds then extinguish after pushing the power button, but the PC didn't boot.

<li>In the past 2 days, the AGI SSD kept disappearing after Windows 10 froze, possibly due to overheating. But then why did the SSD disappear from the UEFI boot even after the PC was turn off for a few minutes? The SSD should have been cool after that. Why did I need to clear BIOS to make the PC boot again?
<li>Replaced the heatsink of AGI 2TB SSD to the one with copper, using 2 1mm thermo-pad. Also moved the AGI SSD to the M2A_32G slot near the CPU. Also attached the CoolerMaster Jetflo 120mm fan to the Hyper-X CPU cooler, and set the fan profile to a bit higher speed even at low load. That should increase air flow above the M2A_32G M.2 SSD slot, thus cooling the AGI 2TB double-sided SSD.
<li>Rearranged the DDR4 RAMs again in this order: DDR4-3600, DDR4-3200 with damaged fingers, DDR4-3600, DDR4-3200. Locked the DRAM voltage to 1.33V, so that all DDR4 RAM could run at 3500Mhz (Multiplier=35).

<li>In the last few days, Win 10 in my Z370-HD3P PC kept freezing while I was merely surfing internet and listening to MP3. Whedn Win 10 froze, the BIOS could no longer detect the two M.2 SSDs (Adata and AGI) the following boot. The first solution was to unplug all DDR4 then plug in DDR4 RAM one-by-one. Clearing CMOS could also do. But Win 10 continued to freeze suddenly.
<li>Today I re-arranged the DDR4 RAMs, DDR4 XMP profiles turned off, then maxed out the speed of both the side panel fan and CPU fan. I also moved the AGI OS SSD from M.2 slot M2Q_32G to slot M2A_32G near the CPU, and disabled Fast Boot. These steps seemed to solve the sudden freeze problem.
<li>Nonetheless, overheating should not have made the BIOS to stop detecting the OS SSD at slot M2Q_32G. Also, boot problems caused by overheating should be gone after turning off the PC. It seemed that when in UEFI mode (CSM disabled), if Win 10 failed to shut down itself properly, the BIOS would ignore the UEFI boot manager in the corresponding OS drive. That's really weird.
<li>The M2Q_32G is indeed hotter since it's next to the GPU PCIe x16 slot. This M.2 slot also supports SATA mode, and share the PCIe lane with the PCIe 4x slot.

Without the custom 64-bit driver (official driver was 32-bit only), that funciton showed up as "SONY USB COMM" with hardware ID "USB\VID_054C&PID_008E".

<li>Disabled PTT, TPM and Resizable BAR (Above 4G Decoding) in BIOS. Unplugged the AData SX8200 Pro M.2 SSD from the M2A_32G slot closest to the CPU, deleted all GPT partitions in the remaining AGI SSD at the M2Q_32G slot, and re-installed Window$ 10 from scratch. The hang-up problem seemed to go away. The Win 10 installation program actually reported GPT partitions not in "reccomended order" for the AGI SSD. The Adata SSD was plugged back in after Win 10 installation, and had all its GPT partitions erased and re-created. Was the instability caused by enabling TPM?

<li>The Dong Guan Gao Yi R.S. 5V,1A AC-DC Switching Adapter (Model: RSS1002-050050-W3U) for the AmyTel Clock Radio was malfunctioning. Seemed that the AC rectifier inside the adapter was no longer working, causing the 5V ouput and hence the radio's USB charging port to turn on and off continuously.Anyway, replacing its AC-DC adapter allow me to use its USB charging port again.
<li>Replacing the power supply didn't solve the problem of the buttons on the top of the radio. They were still not working properly, likely the result of sticky micro-switches or bad de-bouncing. Were the buttons related to firmware as reported on Oct 2020? I still could not tell. I don't even know whether there was programmable firmware inside the main chip.
<li>Opened the AmyTel AB-3128 Clock Radio. There were basically 4 pieces inside: a speaker, the button panel, the LED panel and the main circuit board with DC input & USB port. ASIC chips were found, one of them should be related to Bluetooth.

<li>Micro$oft Office Student and Teacher 200(3?) at HK$888
<li>1+2 HP Computer Warranty COMBO $8999 at HK$998
</ul>
<li>It's strange that the 4 items were not printing in one piece of paper but split into 4 pages. The monitor in the invoice was completely wrong and should have been "HP w1907 19-inch LCD montior". From my memory, no Office 2003 was delivered. When I was asked to attend the delivery, that invoice was never given to me for scanning the list. And the warranty was never used till the last day of the HP a1148hk many years later.
<li>Coincidence? A mind trick? Terrorism? Dark magic? Very likely! That could explain why someone threw a soft plastic ring into that HP-CH28N Blu-Ray Combo Drive of the HP Envy H9 PC, purchased again by my sister to replace the a1148hk. How about the little explosion of TPN-650 power supply and the damage to my Experto computer chair?

Also the Win 10 was re-installed from scratch into this SSD. BTW, I removed the warranty paper stickers from both sides of the SSD.
<li>Swapped the LG DVD burner in Z370-HD3P with the HP CH28N Blu-Ray Combo Drive. Unfortunately, the CH28N kept throwing errors when buring DVD/RW towards the end of the session. Nevertheless, the resulting DVD/RW could still be opened and the files written checked OK. Did the drive aborted the burning process when its burning buffer was empty? Or was head hitting something towards the outer rim of the disc? Needed firmware upgrade?
<li>As an experiement, installed the old Hitachi 160G hard disk into Z370-HD3P. This was the oldest SATA hard disk in my PCs.
<li>Connected the USB 3 Type-E bracket to the Z370-HD3P. It caused RAM errors during first boot. Needed re-plugged it and shaked it a bit to fix the problem.

<li>The first time I tested the Orico 35UTC, it failed to properly mount a 3.5" SATA hard disk . I swapped its AC adapter (12V, 2500mA) with the one from Akasa (12V, 2000mA), it mounted. Then I tried the Orico AC adapter again, it also worked. Possible a badly manufactured 12V socket, requiring careful insertion.
<li>Compare to the Akasa Flexstor Disklink, the Orico 35UTC had a better power LED: blue when idle, purple (blue+red) when there was disk activity. Unplugging the Orico adapter's USB plug from the PC also powered down the hard disk slowly, unlike Akasa. You have to be extremely careful when unplugging the Akasa Flexstor Disklink from the hard disk.
<li>The Orico adapter was about 30% bigger in body size than Akasa nevertheless. Its USB cable was a bit too short and was NOT detachable from the main body, unlike Akasa Flexstore Disklink. However, Orico 35UTC's rubber finish is a bad idea! Why the rubber? Why its color is black not white?

The TDP of the GTX1660 is about 120W, 70W lower than R9 285. As a result, it's about 10 degree Celsius cooler than R9 285. But that may be a result of the shorter adaptor which improved air flow inside the computer chassis.

<li>However, the tracking system of UPS i-Parcel did NOT show that the parcel had been handed over to Hong Kong Post with a new tracking number. Hong Kong Post's sticker with the new tracking number was just an taped sticker on the package. Hong Kong Post's tracking system also did NOT show that the package was received from UPS. This meant the package was "lost" while in transit between UPS and Hong Kong Post. Also, customers would not have the option to pick up the package from UPS collection points.

<li>The card's signal reception power was weaker than the older Mygica X8558 Pro. And its driver could not be reloaded properly after a reboot, causing the card to disappear (driver signing?). It did work fine with Win Server 2012R2 and DVBViewer Recording Service. The card was not a real PCIe adapter design, but a bridge connecting a USB TV tuner with PCIe expansion slots.

<li>While testing a Hopewell RP-261 Neil Portable AM/FM Radio (bought by my sister with invoice missing), accidentally dropped it onto the ground from about 3 feet. The radio's headphone port was connected to a 3.5mm AUX cable from the Denon hi-fi during the fall. This instantly silenced its built-in speaker. Unplugging the AUX cable could not turn the built-in speaker back on. And.... after a few plugging and unplugging, the headphone port failed completely. Now the radio had no sound. 
<li>The RP-261's AM reception was fairly good, possibly due to its "Telescopic Antenna". It required 6V to operate, when you could either use four 'C'/R14 dry batteries or the built-in 220V AC-DC 2-pin port.

<li>The Z370-HD3P is about 2cm shorter than the M5A99X EVO, and they both had an old PCI slot! Z370-HD3P also got internal connectors for serial and parallel ports, but I wondered whether Hong Kong distributor would sell the brackets for them. Z370-HD3P also got two M.2 slots (1 short 2280 and 1 long 22110), with needed screws. There was also a 4-pin header for RGB LEDs. Its BIOS version F7 supports Intel Optane Memory.
<li>This Z370-HD3P has 31 utilities and apps to download from its official website....
<li>Though the Asus M5A99X EVO was nearly 7 years old, I still could not accept that it failed before the older M3N78 PRO from the same manufacturer.

<li>The problem of the M5A99X EVO was not the motherboard nor weather (I supposed), it's the power supply's cable for SATA devices. If I connected only two drives to the 3-slot SATA power cable instead of three, the motherboard POSTed normally.
<li>While I was wondering what's happening in the M5A99X EVO, I phoned Hornington about buying the Asus 970 Pro Gaming/Aura motherboard. Hornington replied that there was no leftover socket AM3 motherboards.
<li>In the trouble-shooting process, discovered that there was a button on the Sapphire R9 285 display card, with blue LED. Of course, you don't press that button while the adapter is powered on.
<li>The motherboard froze then failed to POST again while I was typing this report. However, flipping the power switch trick worked! BUT then .... it froze again. Ghost haunting the board? Ha ha ... haha... ;)
<li>Giving up, reverted back to Asus M3N78 PRO with AMD Phenom 7750, 4+2G DDR2-800 and onboard GeForce 8300. Unable to plug in the dual-fan Radeon R9 295 because the six SATA ports of M3N78 PRO were in the way. Without any SATA devices, the two fans of Radeon R9 285 spin at max speed when it's plugged in the M3N78 PRO, unlike the case when it's plugged into M5A99X EVO. In the latter case, only one fan spin at low speed during POST.
<li>Re-installed Window$ 10 version 1830. Displaying webpages were definitely a bit slow and flashy compared to AMD FX-6300 CPU, 16G DDR3 RAM and Radeon R9 285. Disk I/O rate, with SSD, seemed more or less the same. The onboard GeForce 8300 might not be capable of dealing with the 2540x1152 resolution of Dell U2515H over HDMI cable.
<li>Unlike M5A99X EVO, M3N78 PRO had no diagnostic LEDs nor assisted overclocking! Is that a better thing in the long run? Maybe the POST problem was only caused by the add-on chip and firmware? Or was it just the 12V rail in the motherboard?

<li>The Chassis Q-Fan control also changed the color of the 3.3V voltage reading in Monitor screen from black to red while a fan was connected. Reading was about 2.97V. Should I replaced the power supply because of this 0.4V discrepancy? Could it still be the motherboard?

<li>The 4 insertion protrusions under the left CTRL key-cap of the Logitech G413 was broken. Needed to use the tips of a sharp forceps to scrub out their remains in the troughs so that I could swap the right CTRL key-cap with the left one. Why were they broken so easily after less than one year of frequent use? Puzzling....
<li>To prevent the damage from happening again, inserted a small piece of folded paper under the left CTRL key-cap as cushion to prevent it from being depressed too much.
<li>The default fan profile of the Radeon Crimson Relive driver could no longer cool the Sapphire R9 285. I needed to manually set fan speed to maximum in order to prevent it freezing or crashing my Window 10. Could it be the thermal compound being dried up? Looking back, the GPU was in service for 3 years.
<li>I noticed that the Radeon Crimson Relive driver did NOT always remember my manual fan settings. Bug? Feature? Well.... this could be a trick to "persuade" you to buy a new GPU!
<li>At maximum fan speed setting, the R9 285 still registered a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius. I had only BOINC+SETI@Home running. I really think the default fan profile was over-optimistic. And it's not logical to play with fan speed settings via software. It's very much like dark magic.

<li>In the process of installing memory modules into the Gigabyte PC, a MacBook Air (POWERED ON) fell down from the table above my head. I dunno what happened, and the MacBook Air hit directly onto the hard disk inside the Gigabyte PC chassis. It's lucky that the MacBook Air used SSD not traditional spinning hard disk. It's also lucky that the Gigabyte PC was turned off.
<li>Seemed that the Asus M2N-E was no longer a frequently-used PC as its user also got a MacBook Air, with Win 7 as optional OS via BootCamp.

<td><pre>
Pythagorean: sqrt(162+92) = 18.36
Ratio of w:h:diag is thus: 16:9:18.36

So if the diagonal is 19":
width = (16/18.36)x19 = 16.6"
height = (9/18.36)x19 = 9.3"
area = 16.6*9.3 = 154 in2

A 4:3 19" monitor has 173 in2 of screen area, so you are losing about 13% 
desktop real estate. Better step up to a 21" or 24" if you want widescreen.
